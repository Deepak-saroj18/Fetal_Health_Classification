# Fetal_Health_Classification
Fetal Health Classification uses CTG data to predict fetal health as Normal, Suspect, or Pathological. Through EDA and ML models like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, it evaluates key metrics to provide accurate, data-driven predictions, aiding clinicians in early intervention and improving prenatal care.

# Fetal Health Classification: Predicting Perinatal Outcomes with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to classify fetal health as **Normal**, **Suspect**, or **Pathological** using **Cardiotocography (CTG)** data. The goal is to provide an early, data-driven diagnostic tool to assist healthcare professionals and improve prenatal care outcomes.

## Dataset
- Source: CTG dataset containing **2,126 patient records** and **21 diagnostic features**.
- Features include baseline heart rate, accelerations, decelerations, and histogram metrics.
- The dataset captures fetal heart rate and uterine contractions to assess fetal well-being.

## Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Summary statistics, distributions, and correlations
   - Visualization to understand patterns and relationships

2. **Model Building**
   - Machine Learning Algorithms:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Model training and evaluation using metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score

3. **Prediction & Insights**
   - Predict fetal health categories
   - Support clinical decision-making
   - Reduce subjective interpretation of CTGs

## Key Benefits
- Early detection of at-risk pregnancies
- Assists obstetricians with data-driven second opinions
- Improves prenatal care and reduces maternal and infant mortality
